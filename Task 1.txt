HTTP/1.1 -
It usest works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2 -
It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

objects and its internal representation in Javascript -

An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property’s value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.
Example of object - 
var myLaptop = {
ram : 6
cpu : "Intel i9"
Graphics : "Nvdia GTX 1650 "
Brand : "MSI" 
};

If I want to access ram from above object I can access as below -
myLaptop.ram //output will be 6

The JavaScript standard allows developers to define objects in a very flexible way, and it is hard to come up with an efficient representation that works for everything. We can access properties using two different kinds of expressions:
obj.prop
obj[“prop”]
